# Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website for the projects I complete on the Codecademy platform. I have also included other projects from my consultancy business where I help people set up business websites using mainly Wordpress. 

## Project Objectives
This site is also a project on the Codecademy career path Front End Developer.  

The project objectives were to:
- Build a website using HTML, CSS
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Develop locally on my own computer
- Deploy the site to the web using GitHub Pages
- OPTIONAL: Buy a custom domain name and have it point to my GitHub Pages website

Because I sorely needed to update my own business website for 
Isoz Creative Web I saw an opportunity to use this project to do exactly that.
I went for the option of buying a custom domain name and learn how to point the GitHub 
Pages website to it.

## Features

As my JavaScript feature I first built a kind of slide show at the top of the home page to introduce myself. 
I also use JavaScript to display the header and footer on each page of the site. This is achieved by putting the header and footer html and styling into components and loading them on each page using JavaScript. This has not been taught on the course but I learned through googling and finding a great tutorial here:https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reusable-html-components-how-to-reuse-a-header-and-footer-on-a-website/. 

For styling I used Flexbox, which is the easy way out for me. I will try Grid next time but I am more familiar with Flexbox so went with that. 

I used media queries to adjust the design to different size screens.

One interesting problem I ran into was caused by the logo having a transparent background. It looks great when the page loads, but when you scroll down the content is visible behind the logo which looks wrong. It took a little bit of thinkig about but the solution in the end was quite simple. I used JavaScript to change the background of the logo container to a light color on scroll. It doesn't look as striking as a transparent background but it works.
